/** @file
 *
 * @brief example on how to enroll a new person in a database so that the corresponding ROS node
 *        may notify when the given person is recognized in the left camera image.
 *
 *        First of all, the application asks the user to enter the name of the person to enroll. Then,
 *        the person is asked to stand in front of the robot in order to gather some samples of his/her
 *        face. When the user presses CTRL+C the application stops gathering face samples and proceeds
 *        to enroll the faces with the given name.
 *
 *        Note that a single person must be in front of the robot during the enrollment.
